# rock-paper-scissors
On this project user will play Rock-Paper-Scissors 5 times against the computer.

I practiced functions and their scope.
I used loops and conditionals as well.
It was a good exercise to reinforce the basics of programming and Javascript.

Addendum:
The UI addition was a good challenge and a great way to practice Event Listeners,
functions, arrow functions, functions' scope.

I really enjoyed this part of the project.
